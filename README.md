At the moment i have finished the AMP, DPSGD algorithm. I have managed to implement a private grid search to tune the hyperparameters
of the 2 algorithms, which in the end will be used to give us the accuracy of each model compared to our baseline which is the logistic regression model.

Problems im having now is getting the code for tukeyEM as the code is really complicated and the bigger problem would be whether i can tune it the same way as the AMP and DPSGD algorithm, because the TukeyEM algorithm does have some dimension needs...
