At the moment i have finished the AMP, DPSGD and DPPSGDalgorithm. I have managed to implement a private grid search to tune the hyperparameters
of the 3 algorithms, which in the end will be used to give us the accuracy of each model compared to our baseline which is the logistic regression model.

Problems im having now is getting the code for tukeyEM as the code is really complicated and the bigger problem would be whether i can tune it the same way as the AMP and DPSGD algorithm, because the TukeyEM algorithm does have some dimension needs. Im now trying out with datasets with a lower amount of variables compared to the data that i had first to see if there is a change of results as its the PTR that keep failing with tukeyEM for me, so i have to figure that out. I do have the code for TukeyEM ready though which is based on the google github, but i have been fighting for a week with it and so far i keep getting problems with PTR, in some cases i dont get the problem but only for epsilon values aboven 10.
