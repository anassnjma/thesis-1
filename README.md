Full code for  a comparative analysis of optimization algorithms under private constraints.

The following algorithms are tested:
-AMP
-DP-SGD
-DP-PSGD

First start of by runing the data.py file to get all the datasets to start this experiment. After doing that you can pick which algorithms to test with which datasets by runing expirement.py.
